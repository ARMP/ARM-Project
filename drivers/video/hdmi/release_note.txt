Release note:

-------------------------------
   HDMI Tx modules for TDA998x
             by
    NXP Semiconductors BV
-------------------------------

The release note gives all necessary detail for installation in Linux
kernel and application tunning. Installation is Linux typical and does
not require any HDMI background. A default video and audio setting is
defined in hdmi_tx_init function. It can be changed at will.
There is no porting to do, it is already provided in module. And the
classical HDMI DevLib is embedded in it. But the UserManual is still
usefull for customers who like to optimise the module according to
their needs. If so, feedback is welcome. ;)
Customers who like to drive the module from userland can do it using
IOCTL. IOCTL maps the classical HDMI API. Using the WAIT_FRAME IOCTL,
userland can catch HDMI events like Hot Plug Detect, RxSens or EDID.

So the two main functions the customer needs to take care are :
- hdmi_tx_init
- eventCallbackTx

For OMAP architecture, a DSS plugin is provided. So in order to activate
HDMI (switch DSS to HDMI output) just prompt on target:
echo "3" > /sys/power/vdd2_lock
echo "1" > /sys/devices/platform/omapdss/display2/enabled
And desactivate : 
echo "0" > /sys/devices/platform/omapdss/display2/enabled

-------------------------------

- Installation :

 * On host:
  . mkdir $KERNEL_MODULES
  . cp linux-hdmi-nxp-modules.v##.cvfj $KERNEL_MODULES/.
  . cd $KERNEL_MODULES
  . tar xvfj linux-hdmi-nxp-modules.v##.cvfj
  . update LINUX_DIR in hdmi/MakeModules with your kernel directory path
  . select your TDA target in Makefile :  for example TDA_TX := TDA9984  !!! CAUTION, don't forget this !!!
  . select your platform in Makefile :  for example TDA_PLATFORM := ZOOMII
  . cd hdmi
  . make -f MakeModules clean (optional for the first time)
  . make -f MakeModules
  . make -f MakeModules uptx (or any download mean that does not use adb)
  . make -f MakeModules upcec (or any download mean that does not use adb)
  . cd hdcp
  . make -f MakeModules
  . make -f MakeModules up (or any download mean that does not use adb)
 * Application (optional), better use your own, this one is just a sample
  . cd test
  . make clean (optional for the first time)
  . make
  . make upload (or any download mean that does not use adb)
 * On target:
  . insmod hdmitx.ko verbose=1 (remove verbose to make the module silent)
  . insmod hdmicec.ko verbose=1 device=4 (remove verbose to make the module silent)
  . insmod nwolc.ko (only for HDCP)
 * On TV
  . connect TV to target

- Usage :

  . hdmitx module parameters used with insmod :
    > verbose: Make the driver verbose
    > major: The major number of the device mapper
  . hdmicec module parameters used with insmod :
    > verbose: Make the driver verbose
    > major: The major number of the device mapper
    > device: Device type can be 0:tv, 1:rec 3:tuner 4:mediaplayer, 5:audio
    > addr: Physical address (until EDID received)
  . modules handles automaticaly HPD, EDID and following CEC messaging :
    device connectivity and addressing, routing, standby, OSD name,
    vendor name features.
  . tda_demo test application show how to take control of the two modules
    from userland and catch CEC messages
    BUT HDMI MODULES CAN RUN WITHOUT IT
  . HDCP feature is only supported if nwolc module is installed, you can
    add it or remove it dynamically using insmod nwolc.ko and rmmod nwolk.

- FAQ :

  . "this->driver.i2c_client not allocated" :
    1) Declare your I2C bus usage in arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-zoom2.c as follow :
    | static struct i2c_board_info __initdata zoom2_i2c_bus3_info[] = {
	|        {I2C_BOARD_INFO(TX_NAME,  TDA998X_I2C_SLAVEADDRESS),},
	|        {I2C_BOARD_INFO(CEC_NAME,  TDA99XCEC_I2C_SLAVEADDRESS),},
    | };
    2) Check the TDA target in Makefile :  for example TDA_TX := TDA9984

  . "Video format and plan are strange..." :
    Check tda.setio.videoout/in in hdmi_tx_init() function of tda998x.c

  . "The resolution is not the one I want" :
    Update or create your own omap_video_timings structure and change
    the video resolution of this->tda.setio.video_out.format in hdmi_tx_init()

  . I want "720p@60Hz" :
    1- Line 860: Uncomment> /*    this->tda.setio.video_out.format = TMDL_HDMITX_VFMT_04_1280x720p_60Hz; */
    2- Line 862: Comment> this->tda.setio.video_out.format = TMDL_HDMITX_VFMT_02_720x480p_60Hz;
    3- Line 1051: Replace> video_720x480at60Hz_panel_timings with video_1280x720at60Hz_panel_timings

  . "I would like to get debug message" :
    Install the module with debug messages > insmod hdmitx.ko verbose=1 

  . "I would like to see the EDID of the TV" :
    Install the module with debug messages > insmod hdmitx.ko verbose=1 


  . "On the TV display some pixel are flickering" :
    Check the OMAP DSS setup and update the dssdev->panel.config parameters

  . "CEC send Samsung vendor ID" :
    Yes, otherwise you cannot use Samsung devices... replace is by your own

  . "I don't use OMAP"
    This module contains an OMAP Display SubSystem plugin that automatically
    drives video output of OMAP (video input of TDA). If you don't have OMAP
    remove the ANDROID_DSS (or add your PLATFORM flag in Makefile) and do
    the video bus configuration at your convience. Anyhow, any other usefull 
    plugin is welcome... So please feedback ;)

  . "How to install HDMI module ?"
    See installation chapter above.

  . "HDCP is not supported"
    Ask NXP to deliver you the proprietary HDCP module

  . "HDCP module does not work"
    Ask NXP to provide you your customer seed number...

  . "How can I control the HDMI with my apps ?"
    Use open("/dev/hdmitx") to get access to HdmiTx module.
    Then use ioctl as described in tda998x_ioctl.h.

  . "How can I control CEC with my apps ?"
    Use open("/dev/hdmicec") to get access to HdmiCec module.
    Then use ioctl as described in tda998x_ioctl.h.

  . "How can my application get the HDMI event ?"
    Create a dedicated incoming event thread in your apps and use ioctl WAIT_EVENT

  . "Is is mandatory to create an incoming event thread in my apps ?"
    No if you don't care.

  . "Did I need to create some apps to make HDMI running ?"
    No, you can modify hdmi_tx_init according to your needs and install the
    modules in your init.rc. Hdmi will run automatically.

- Restriction :

  . Remove IRQ flag in Makefile for timer based polling
  . Add ZOOMII_PATCH to reverse clock edge in ZOOMII
  . add TWL4030_HACK to get keypad handle and inject CEC::USER_CONTROL events
  . omap_dss_driver might not be supported by kernel, then hdmi_enable
    and hdmi_disable should be triggered by any other kernel means or
    replaced by direct call from application using:
    -->  ioctl(my_fd,TDA_IOCTL_SET_POWER,[tmPowerOn|tmPowerStandby]);
  . HDCP can not be switch off dynamically with TDA_IOCTL_SET_HDCP but
    removing nwolc.ko module
